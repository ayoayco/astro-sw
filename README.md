The integration accepts path to your own authored [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) and automatically injects dynamic variables such as `__assets` generated by Astro for caching. The goal is to let devs retain the flexibility for various [caching strategies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/caching-strategies-overview/).

Other integrations exist which will generate a service worker for you, but [there are good reasons](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-build#when_not_to_use_generatesw) to avoid this.

## Installation

In your [Astro](https://astro.build) project:

```bash
# if using npm
$ npm i -D @ayco/astro-sw

# if using pnpm
$ pnpm add -D @ayco/astro-sw
```

## Usage

Example `astro.config.mjs`

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import serviceWorker from "@ayco/astro-sw";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    serviceWorker({
      path: "./src/sw.js",
    })
  ]
});
```

## API

The integration accepts a configuration object of type `ServiceWorkerConfig` with the following properties

| property | type | required? |  notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| path | string | required | path to your *own* service worker script; no surprises & easy debugging |
| assetCachePrefix | string | optional | cache storage name prefix; useful for debugging |
| assetCacheVersionID | string | optional | cache storage name versioning; by default, a random UUID is used but you can provide your own for easy debugging & invalidation |
| customRoutes | string[] | optional | list of custom routes you want to be cached. Beware that non-existent routes that result to HTTP Error404 will cause the service worker to fail |
| excludeRoutes | string[] | optional | list of routes you want to be ignored/removed from assets |

## Example sw.js

You can find an example service worker (`example_sw.js`) in the [repository](https://ayco.io/gh/astro-sw), and here's the [raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayoayco/astro-sw/main/example_sw.js) too.
