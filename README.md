> **>>> TL;DR:** Simple Astro integration to use your own authored service-worker; by default, devs retain full control as opposed to getting generated sw code

# Astro SW

The integration `serviceWorker` accepts configuration with service worker path and automatically injects needed dynamic variables such as `assets` generated by Astro for caching

## Usage

Example `astro.config.mjs`

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import node from "@astrojs/node";
import serviceWorker from "@ayco/astro-sw";

export default defineConfig({
  output: "server",
  adapter: node({
    mode: "middleware"
  }),
  integrations: [
    serviceWorker({
      path: "./src/sw.js",
      assetCachePrefix: 'cozy-reader',
    })
  ]
});
```

## API

The integration accepts a configuration object of type `ServiceWorkerConfig` with the following properties

| property | type | required? |  notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| path | string | required | path to your *own* service worker script; no surprises & easy debugging |
| assetCachePrefix | string | optional | cache storage name prefix; useful for debugging & invalidation |
| assetCacheVersionID | string | optional | cache storage name versioning; by default, a random UUID is used but you can provide your own for easy debugging |
