Use your own authored [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) with Astro.

The integration accepts the path to your service worker and automatically injects dynamic variables such as `__assets` generated by Astro for caching.

It works on all Astro output options: `static`, `server`, or `hybrid`, and lets developers retain the flexibility for various [caching strategies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/caching-strategies-overview/).

## Background

This integration was originally developed to support the Caching strategy needs of [Cozy](https://cozy.pub) -- the modern reading companion for the Web. You can find [an example service worker in the repository](https://github.com/ayoayco/Cozy/blob/main/src/sw.mjs).

There is a work in progress adding `presets` for using common caching strategies and customizing the behavior of the service worker via config options. This aims to reduce the need for writing the service worker script by hand for most use cases.

## Installation

In your [Astro](https://astro.build) project:

```bash
# if using npm
$ npm i @ayco/astro-sw

# if using pnpm
$ pnpm add @ayco/astro-sw
```

## Minimal Usage

Here's an example `astro.config.mjs` file:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import serviceWorker from "@ayco/astro-sw";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    serviceWorker({
      path: "./src/sw.ts",
    }),
  ],
});
```

For more options available, see the [API](#api).

## TypeScript support

We use `esbuild` to resolve service worker `imports` and build TS files! You can customize the build options by providing it to the `esbuild` configuration property.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import serviceWorker from "@ayco/astro-sw";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    serviceWorker({
      path: "./src/sw.ts",
      esbuild: {
        minify: true,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Injected variables

The most important variable your service worker will have access to is `__assets`, which contains all routes and public assets that Astro includes in your build. Additionally, you will also get `__prefix` and `__version` you can use for naming & invalidating your Cache storage (useful for debugging purposes).

## `eslint` globals

Because of the injected variables not being defined in your script, you might get `eslint` errors for the undefined variables when you have the `no-undef` rule. To prevent this, you can use our exported `globals` object in your eslint config as follows:

```js
import astroSwGlobals from "@ayco/astro-sw/globals";

export default [
  {
    languageOptions: {
      globals: {
        ...astroSwGlobals,
      },
    },
  },
  // add more generic rule sets here, such as:
  // jsPlugin.configs.recommended,
];
```

## Registration Hooks

Hooks are provided for adding custom logic that triggers in various service worker registration events.

The following properties are available for the `registrationHooks` configuration:

1. `installing` - when the registration is 'installing'
1. `waiting` - when the registration is 'waiting'
1. `active` - when the registration is 'active'
1. `error` - when the registration throws an error
1. `unsupported` - when the service workers are unsupported
1. `afterRegistration` - after the registration succeeds

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import serviceWorker from "@ayco/astro-sw";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    serviceWorker({
      path: "./src/sw.ts",
      registrationHooks: {
        afterRegistration: async () => {
          const sw = await navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration();
          console.log(">>> registrered", sw);
        },
        installing: () => console.log("installing..."),
        waiting: () => console.log("waiting..."),
        active: () => console.log("active..."),
        error: (error) => console.error(error),
        unsupported: () => console.log(":("),
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## API

The integration accepts a configuration object with the following properties
